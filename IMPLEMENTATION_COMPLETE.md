**File:** `src/components/Header.tsx` (+25 lines)

### âœ… 2. Mobile Navigation - Specular Highlights
- Per-button mouse position tracking
- Specular highlights on all 5 navigation buttons
- Independent highlight tracking for each button
- Consistent 30% white opacity with smooth transitions

**File:** `src/components/MobileNav.tsx` (+80 lines)

### âœ… 3. Button Animations - Advanced Fluid Effects
- Enhanced liquidWiggle animation (4 â†’ 8 keyframes)
- New advancedButtonPress animation
- Combines wiggle, squish, and glow effects
- Physics-based motion with cubic-bezier easing

**Files:** 
- `src/components/primitives/GlowButton.tsx` (+2 lines)
- `src/index.css` (+50 lines)

### âœ… 4. CSS Animations - Enhanced Effects
- Enhanced liquidWiggle: More complex rotation, independent scale transforms
- New advancedButtonPress: Combines multiple effects with pulsing glow
- New animation utility class: `.animate-advancedButtonPress`

**File:** `src/index.css` (+50 lines)
